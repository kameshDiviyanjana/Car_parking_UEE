The project at hand is the development of “ParkWiz”, a vehicle parking management system based in Sri Lanka. Our primary goal is to provide a convenient and efficient solution for reserving parking spots in selected car parks. This system is essential as it aims to improve the parking experience for both local and foreign users in Sri Lanka.
Parking in cites can often be a frustration experience, and our project seeks to address this issue. We’re creating a mobile app that allows users to reserve their preferred parking spots online and make secure payments. This system is crucial in the context of Sri Lanka’s growing urbanization and the increasing need for efficient parking solutions.
The target market includes a wide range of users, including property owners, ticket inspectors, foreign visitors, and local residents. The importance of this project lies in simplifying city parking, marketing it user-friendly, and enhancing the overall parking experience. Our system’s success will contribute to reduce parking hassles and improved convenience for everyone using it, ultimately making cities more accessible and enjoyable.
